<!-- Hamster Hotel  -->
<!-- For my website I made a hamster htoel using conatianers, rows, colamons. I also used bootstrap to align the text and the foundation of the website.  -->
<!-- peer reviewed by: Jayvon Khuth - Overall the website has the correct layout for everything, however a lot of the spacing and sizes are wrong. For example a lot of the pictures are the wrong size, the spacing between the sections don't match, and even the background images aren't correctly centered. Another thing I noticed was that your website is not responsive, when I reduce the size to a phone or tablet, it gets all messy. Also I noticed that the nav bar gets squished too, I suggest maybe adding a hamburger button for the nav bar. I also suggest that you maybe mess around with the spacing of the sections using things like margins or padding, and you could even possibly edit the sizes of the images too. For the background images you can use things like background-position to try and position them correctly.-->
